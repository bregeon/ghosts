Installing ghosts
====================

At some point you will be able to install `ghosts` with `pip` or from source.
`ghosts` depends upon `batoid`, call it even just an extension if you wish.


Installing with pip
-------------------

This is will work, believe me.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ghosts



Installing from source
-----------------------

Since `ghosts` is all python code, this is pretty easy.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/bregeon/ghosts.git
    cd ghosts
    python setup.py install
